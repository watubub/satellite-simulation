# Satellite Simulation

Created a simulation to answer the following quesiton: "How many satellites can be launched into orbit before astronomers on Earth can no longer observe the night sky without interruption?"

This was part of the 2020 New Zealand Engineering Science Competition where my team was awarded $2000 for coming runner-up.
